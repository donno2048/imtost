# imtost for specific groups and numbers

## To choose groups and numbers:

Put lists of phone numbers and groups' numbers in _index.js_ where `NUMBERS` and `GROUPS` are respectively.

The numbers suppose to be integers (for example the Israeli number (+972) 52-123-4567 would be written as 972521234567).

Finding the group number should use a clever method, but the best way I could achieve that is by opening the link to the group's image and finding the `u` tag, the group number is the second number there
